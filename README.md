Glossary of terms commonly used in higher category theory, especially when working with quasicategories. Where possible, I have compared higher categorical terms with their 1-categorical equivalents (reformulated to look as similar as possible), and attempted to provide some intuition for the form of the generalisation. 

This is currently very incomplete (and possibly wrong in places); it will develop and grow as I learn more higher category theory. This is mainly a place for me to document my current understanding of the language, but I have made it public in case others find it helpful. Please send any mistakes/comments to: ali.ramsey "at" uni-hamburg.de.

Questions or points I'm unsure about are in red.
